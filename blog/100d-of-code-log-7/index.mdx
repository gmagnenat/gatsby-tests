## Scene graph

Grouping things can become handy when we want to rotate or scale several objects together.
If we build a house with walls and a roof we don't want to apply the transformations seperately on each elements.
We can group all objects in a container.

```javascript
/**
 * Objects
 */
const group = new THREE.Group();
group.scale.y = 2;
group.rotation.y = 0.2;
scene.add(group);

const cube1 = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
);
cube1.position.x = -1.5;
group.add(cube1);

const cube2 = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
);
cube2.position.x = 0;
group.add(cube2);

const cube3 = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 })
);
cube3.position.x = 1.5;
group.add(cube3);
```
