## What ?

### What are non-fungible tokens?

Non-fungible tokens are a new type of digital asset that is valuable by itself, not by the value it has in the project it's used in. NFTs are an adaptation of ERC-721 tokens created on the Ethereum network. They are similar to collectible items like baseball cards or Pokemon cards with one important difference - no two NFTs are exactly alike. The value of NFTs isn't based on the items they represent - it's based on the ledger created when the NFT is transferred.

### What properties make them different from fungible tokens?

Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are a type of digital asset that cannot be divided and used as any other token. Meaning, each token can only be used for one purpose and can't be exchanged or transferred to other uses. Whereas fungible tokens can be divided into smaller units and used as other tokens. NFTs go by many names such as: unique, non-divisible, rare, etc.

### Why are they important to the blockchain ecosystem?

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens with unique digital assets. This makes them scarce and can be used as a representation of an item. The most common NFT is CryptoKitties, which was the first game to implement blockchain technology with non-fungible tokens.

### Conclusion

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are unique assets that can be traded and owned. They can be used to create a decentralized record of ownership and validate the authenticity and ownership of scarce digital goods. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which promote fungibility - tradeability between any other token - NFTs cannot be exchanged for one another.

# Notes

**Fungability**  
1$ is on 1$ A dollar value stays exactly the same  
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin

The value of an item and its **use** determines whether it is fungible or non-fungible

### why is a watch non-fungible?

You will not trade a casio for a rolex. there is a value depreciation. the serial code matters. Exact same models can have different value.  
Stamps value are non-fungible as well. One stamp from 1950 has not the same value as the exact same stamp from 2021.

### key traites of non-fungible

- unique
- irreplacable
- non-interchangeable  
  swapping them doesn't work as the value is different

## Why ?

Nft's are becoming more and more important as they provide a secure, transparent system for value exchange. Nft's will play a crucial role in the field of health care. It will be easier to track how drugs are administered and distribute, thereby improving public health. The tokens also allow for a clear tracking of pharmaceuticals so they can be removed from circulation if need be.

In a digital world ownership was never clearly defined.  
Is the ownership recorded somewhere? is it tracable?  
Only works if the serial code is linked to the purchase and buyer.
Most of digital assets are not ment for resel. Think of a domain name, a game skin or a concert ticket.  
It is possible to resel them but there are no easy mechanism to transfer the ownership.  
**Ownership** means you can freely re-sell the good you own.

There is no unified way to track ownership whatsover it is.  
That is what NFT is trying to solve. The right to ownership, the right to re-sell through different mechanism.  
It starts with the proofs; an e-mail? is it publicly traced? There must be a better way.

The token that represent the right to ownership, is the **why**. Through that concept we get into **Blockchain**, a decentralized ledger. A technology that enables other concept to build uppon it.

Through the proof of ownership, we can enable marketplaces, tradability, resellability. The generic concept is there.

## How ?

The blockchain powers NFTS  
Blockchain is a type of decentralized storage  
A million of little block copied accross multiple different system and everyone keeps a ledger of that data. Blockchain is a concept, it is how we use it and implement it that defines the technology (Bitcoin, ethereum, etc). Because everything is built on the blockchain doesn't mean it has the same value. That's why bitcoin has a different economics then ethereum is like the oil of the blockchain industry, you burn it to get things done. By burning it you spend energy.  
Blockchain itself is the decentralized storage portion.

### What are we getting out of the blockchain ?

- interoperability
- tradeability
- immutability
- liquidity
- programmability
