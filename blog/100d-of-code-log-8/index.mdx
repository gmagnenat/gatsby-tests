## What ?

### What is a non-fungible token (NFT)

It is the proof of ownership of an asset

Nun-fungible refers to the fact that it is unique and cannot be replaced

| fungible | non-fungible |
| -------- | :----------- |
| Bitcoin  | Watch        |
| Cash     | Plane ticket |
|          | Stamps       |

1$ is on 1$  
A dollar value stays exactly the same  
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin

The value of an item and its **use** determines whether it is fungible or non-fungible

### why is a watch non-fungible?

You will not trade a casio for a rolex. there is a value depreciation. the serial code matters. Exact same models can have different value.  
Stamps value are non-fungible as well. One stamp from 1950 has not the same value as the exact same stamp from 2021.

### key traites of non-fungible

- unique
- irreplacable
- non-interchangeable  
  swapping them doesn't work as the value is different
