### Interoperability

### Immutability

Blockchain records data in a way that makes it hard to change

### Tradeability

The ability to be traded freely on open marketplaces

### Liguidity

Transfer nfts into token for liquidity

### programmability

Embed code into the nft to make it smarter  
if it can contain code and thing that can executed, it can become smarter than just flat data.

### Ethereum, what is it?

Bitcoin is the gold. Ethereum is the oil. It is able to power what people want as long as you are willing to burn ethereum to complete something. As long as you are willing to burn the token as gaz, they have a whole network and development guy that can teach you how to do a ton of different stuff.  
**_Ethereum is a programmable blockchain_**.  
It allows to take code, deploy it on the blockchain and execute it. They controle what type of code is allowd to be executed on the ethereum network. There's contracts to deploy an app.
Anything on Ethereum is an address "wallet" and you can interact with that addresse.  
Ethereum is a coin. Ethereum needs to be burned in order to do transactions. We can deploy code onto Ethereum to do things.  
NFT means ethereum has a way to define in code the specifics of ownership and because of that we use Ethereum to power nfts. Ethereum has built nfts standard into the blockchain technology that they've built to ensure that theres one interface for defining what an nft looks like. For that we need smart contracts.

### Smart contract

Smart contract is a pice of code that we deploy on the ethereum network that becomes its own entity.
